# 🔬 AI Research Copilot (GPT + RAG)

A production-style AI application that allows users to chat with research papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, and OpenAI GPT models.

Built to simulate how modern AI research assistants work — providing cited answers, evidence extraction, and intelligent summaries.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Modern AI systems are shifting from pure generation to retrieval-based intelligence.

This project demonstrates how production-grade AI assistants are built using RAG pipelines — combining semantic search with large language models to produce accurate, explainable outputs.
